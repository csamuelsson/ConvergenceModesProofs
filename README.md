# ConvergenceModesProofs
Just a simple helper program for me to study the proofs of the relationships between probabilistic modes of convergences :)

Used for a course in measure theoretic probability theory.

To run:
<code>git clone https://github.com/csamuelsson/ConvergenceModesProofs</code>
<code>python3 QuestionGenerator.py</code>
